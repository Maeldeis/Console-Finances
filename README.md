Week 4 challenge

I have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.
My task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * Track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/(Number of months - 1)`)

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.
